# A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).
#
# The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).
#
# Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?
#
#
#
# An obstacle and empty space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.
#
# Note: m and n will be at most 100.
